# Low-Voltage-Power-Supply

Build a power supply that takes power at 120V, 60 hertz [ Hz] AC from a wall outlet and converts it to DC. The power supply is adjustable between 2V to 12V and can supply currents up to 1A

(Will update more once I could borrow an osciloscope)

Comments: The maximum voltage I can achieve is 11.1V. This is because the resistor I used was higher than 390 Ohm since I could not find that exact resistor with the current materials I have.
